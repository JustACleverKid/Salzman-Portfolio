    <p><strong>Curbside Thai</strong> brings the rich flavor of Thailand to 
        North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35 
        years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers 
        that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte 
        with our modern mobile food truck.</p>
        
    <p>This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy 
        paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various 
        mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from 
        11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and 
        11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the 
        difference! If you can't get away from your desk, 
        <em>Curbside Thai will deliver</em>.</p>
        
    <p>Contact us to cater your next party and experience 
        what <cite>Carolina Traveler</cite> calls <q>the finest Asian food 
        on or off the streets of Charlotte</q>.</p>
